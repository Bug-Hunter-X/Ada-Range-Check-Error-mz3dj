This repository contains an Ada program demonstrating a common range checking error. The function `Check_Range` is intended to check if a number is within the range 10 to 20 (inclusive). However, it contains a logical error that causes it to return incorrect results for values outside this range. The solution demonstrates how to correct this error and ensure the function always returns the expected boolean result.
